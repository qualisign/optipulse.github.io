Mesh Market: A Platform Business for the People, by the People

(being a free marketplace for decentralizing resources on the Blockchain)

* Introduction

Mesh Market is a free application aiming to:

- introduce the benefits of peer-to-peer goods and services to the public at large
- enable consumers to find friendlier and cheaper local alternatives to centrally-owned, inefficient resources
- accelerate deployment and improve market viability of beneficial technologies by providing them with a direct-to-consumer platform

With Mesh Market, you can:
- get cheaper, better internet service
- start a do-it-yourself ISP
- start a profitable energy business from your own home
- reduce your electricity bills while supporting renewable energy
- do countless other things we haven't thought of, and some we have (check out more use cases, or read on for an overview of how it works)

Check out the prototype (under construction -- very early stage, and obviously can't handle transactions yet!):
https://optipulse.github.io


* Background
The Mesh Market app was originally conceived by developers at OptiPulse who were envisioning a direct-to-consumer platform for getting its internet technology
into the market.  Eventually it was realized that the same infrastructure could be used to decentralize resources besides bandwidth, and the Mesh Market Foundation was
created to promote the full potential of the app.
** The Light Grid
We believe that OptiPulse's Light Grid will come to dominate future internet infrastructure.  It is a revolutionary physical-layer technology based on a novel invention in electro-optics.  Like other elite photonic transmitters, it is capable of 5G bit-rates; unlike fiber-optics, however, it is wireless and easy to deploy.
This makes it very cheap in comparison to the standard alternatives.  Besides being competitive with some of the best fiber-optics, it comes with a range of other benefits:
*** Distance
Early tests and estimates have projected that the Light Grid's transmission range may be over 10 km.  This is significantly far for optical wireless technologies.
*** Deployability
Unlike fiber-optics, there is no digging up of long stretches of earth to connect two end-points.  This is typically the brunt of the cost associate with FO.  As you can imagine,
this also avoids legal difficulties like zoning laws.
*** Unlicensed Spectrum
The Light Grid uses a part of the RF spectrum that isn't licensed.  Not only is signal interference negligible compared to typical broadcast connections like WiFi, but contending with competitors
over spectrum licensing is also a non-issue.
*** Ecological Friendliness
Taking load off the typical spectrum range also has huge benefits to living organisms, which many believe are harmed by the proliferation of microwaves in the atmosphere used for
communication.
*** Low Size, Weight
Did we mention how small the Light Grid is?

*** Low Power-Consumption

** Platform Business
*** Overview
A platform business erases the distinction between producers and consumers of goods and services.  It does this by providing consumers with some form of infrastructure for creating value on their own.  This can be
something as unassuming as a mobile app, as in the case of Uber.  Such businesses tend to uncover value already existent, but previously unrecognized - mainly because it resides in the hands of consumers.
Platform business have shown us that value of this sort actually constitutes the lion's share of the market - when it is effectively utilized.
As Tech Crunch put it,
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
"Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no vehicles. Facebook, the world’s most popular media owner,
 creates no content. Alibaba, the most valuable retailer, has no inventory. And Airbnb, the world’s largest
accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening."
#+END_SRC



This trend is likely to intensify in the coming years, as the ease of access to information driving it undoubtedly will.  But as we've seen lately with Uber and AirBnB's legal battles, this won't go unopposed.
Despite the innocuous tenets of the "sharing economy" -- with which these companies would like to identify -- this opposition is merited in many cases; if you look under the hood, it's business as usual.
The 'Invisible Hand' is just as unlikely to guide a giant platform as it is a giant pipeline to make altruistic decisions at the expense of profit.  Examples aren't hard to find in current news headlines; in Britain, regulators are taking issue with
the convenience with which Uber can hire full-time workers without taking on the responsibilities of a full-time employer.  Contractors also complain about the substantial cut it takes from drivers, typically 20%, which
indeed seems hefty considering the labor involved by the contractors.  As mentioned, platform businesses facing such criticism seek to identify themselves with the larger picture -- they are purveyors of the sharing economy that average-joes are so keen on.
AirBnb, for instance, is promoting a global consumer movement as a shield to their foreseeable legal woes.  But before consumers rise to the defense of the sharing economy à la Uber, might it not be better to ask for a better platform?  If so many people are willing to defend the admittedly imperfect platforms they've come to rely on, why can't these same people
organize behind a better platform?  We believe the demand for this platform exists already, though it is yet to be realized.  Mesh Market strives to become this platform.



** Mesh Networking
Before we discuss how Mesh Market makes it so easy to decentralize resources, we need to explain the role that mesh networking plays.

According to Wikipedia, "A mesh network is a network topology in which each node relays data for the network. All mesh nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network."

In other words, mesh networks get rid of centralized computing resources in favor of distributed networks.

Mesh Market takes this concept to the next level and seeks to decentralize all resources (insofar as that's possible).

The original goal of this app was to develop OptiPulse unique potential for revolutionizing the mesh/ad-hoc networking market with its Light Grid technology.  Bandwidth, via mesh-networking, is the first resource
that Mesh Market aims to decentralize - though by no means the last.While the mesh-networking userbase is presently miniscule compared to that of conventional, centrally serviced connections (usually provided by one of only a few differnet ISP's), meshes offer many advantages
over heterogeneous networks, making them the ideal network topology for future networks needing to prioritize scalability.  There are many articles/papers weighing these advantages, so the discussion here will be brief:

*** Advantages
**** Scalability:
Adding more devices to the network tends to improve mesh connections, in contrast to star topologies.  More devices connected to a mesh network locally means more possible paths through which internet traffic can be routed.
**** Robustnesss:
There is no central point of failure in a mesh network.  Power outages, network attacks, and threats to individual nodes circulate and infect the entire network, as in a star topology.
Those who were able to get WIFI in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy know this isn't mere speculation.  http://techpresident.com/news/23127/red-hook-mesh-network-connects-sandy-survivors-still-without-power

**** Democritization:
It is virtually impossible to "shut down" a mesh network the way dictators have been known to do in recent years (e.g. in Egypt during Arab Spring). Without the imperitave for centrally-connected hubs, disrupting connections becomes very hard to achieve.
http://europe.newsweek.com/dictator-proofing-internet-68705?rm=eu

That authorities might cut off the internet is significantly less likely in countries without egregious network collusion with government as we
see in many developing countries (Sorry Donald Trump http://fortune.com/2015/12/08/donald-trump-bill-gates-internet/.)  Such countries may turn out to be some of the
best stages on which to demonstrate the power of decentralized markets for effecting positive social change.

One criticism of the idea that mesh networks could make the internet impervious to control by dictators is that WIFI signals can be traced and individuals can be targeted even
if the network is a mesh https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/12/dictators_shutt.html#c1034991.  This criticism would not apply to a network using OptiPulse's
technology, since its point-to-point signals are not broadcast and would be very difficult to intercept.

*** Disadvantages, Obstacles
There are also several difficulties associated with meshes that shouldn't be overlooked.  Some of these may be mitigated by the design of an app fulfilling many
functions normally assigned to the network administrator, while others may be reducable to inadequacies of current physical layer internet technologies that OptiPulse's (a key partner)
Light Grid may improve on.
**** Power Consumption
From link-labs: "Because each node in a mesh has to act as an endpoint and a router, it has to draw more power to operate. Thus, if you have battery-powered, low-power nodes, a mesh may be difficult to deploy without a lot of network planning."
This is listed as a disadvantage, but OptiPulse's Light Grid requires very little power consumption, which may make it an enabling technology for mesh networks.
**** Latency
Likewise, this is listed as a disadvantage, but a copious amount of bandwidth is one of the Light Grid's chief assets.
**** Requisite Technical Competence
Currently, most mesh networking protocols are available solely as command line tools for Unix-like operating systems.  As it stands, this significantly reduces the class of users
capable of connecting to a mesh network.
**** Opposition from Established Middlemen
Analagous to the situation faced by Tesla due to their direct-to-consumer market, those who normally take a large share of the profits by acting as middle-men
between the consumer and the product/service stand to lose much in a decentralized consumer-to-consumer market.  This means that, just as Tesla sales have been
blocked in certain states due to the threat it poses to the established car-dealership model (https://electrek.co/2016/05/01/tesla-gm-direct-sales-connecticut/),
a mesh-networking platform with a chance of succeeding may raise the defenses of ISP's. This possibility should be discussed in more detail.  It seems to me that
the case against a mesh-networks would be much more difficult to make, and legal challenges are unlikely to pose a sustained threat.
** Blockchain
Blockchain technology is based on the idea of a distributed ledger.  It is meant to provide trust and security through radical transparency rather than limited access.
Blockchain plays a crucial role in Mesh Market's plan to overcome the inertia keeping local value creation from being released.
*** Smart Contracts
The concept of a smart contract was first formulated in the 90's, but required blockchain technology to achieve practical implementability.  Basically a smart contract is
a contract that can execute itself.  This means that terms and conditions are defined programatically, such that a computer can know how they should be interpreted.
Of course, this limits the contents of the contract what is computationally tractable.  For example, a smart contract may define certain operations being executed when an
account on the blockchain receives a certain amount of funds.
*** Ethereum

* The Mesh Market Platform
It may not seem obvious from the above simplistic discussion of smart contracts, but the ability for computers to listen to data and execute transactions on a blockchain enables
an innumerable array of business solutions heretofore unworkable or impractical to be implemented- particularly those based on the idea of turning a traditionally top-down service into a consumer-to-consumer platform.
Decentralized platforms based on blockchain/smart contracts are already being developed across a range of industries (even entire governemnts!), though it is still too early
for average consumers to have noticeably benefited.  The platform business phenomenon and the sharing economy at large, on the other hand, have had a huge impact on what customers expect from the services they use,
and demonstrated the substantial demand for useful peer-to-peer services.

Of course, there is no shortage of useful ideas and technologies that would have a positive impact, if they were only adopted - if is collective will to do so that stagnates.  We made the case for beneficial communication technologies above;
others are making it for renewable energy, vegetarianism, a basic income, and so on.  The ultimate goal of Mesh Market is to create a way to incentivize collective behavior that is manifestly positive.  The purpose of the Mesh Market Protocol is to define this behavior.  Finally, the Mesh Market Foundation channels funds into
businesses that seek to implement these solutions, and incentivizes businesses (and people) to use the platform.  Mesh Market the DApp should be thought of as one part of this eco-system.

It would be unwise for any business developing in the post-smart contract world to implement an overtly top-down approach to customer relations.  We take very seriously
the idea that whatever can be decentralized will be decentralized as the world awakens to the utility of the Blockchain.  Of course, this includes any aspects of the Mesh Market platform that
are inadvertently top-down or fail to prioritize customers' priorities.  This is why we open the design of the Mesh Market platform to feedback and revision via the Protocol.
The Mesh Market aspires to be the platform to end platforms; to achieve this, there must be built-in mechanisms for self-correction.

*** Case Study: OptiPulse -- Making Mesh Networks Mass-Market Viable
Now we'll discuss how these principles can apply to promoting mesh networks, which could enable several exciting use-cases for the Mesh Market.

Since the benefits of mesh networks are not immediately apparent to anyone not versed in computer networking, getting people to switch may prove a difficult task unless some
incentive is provided.

OptiPulse's incredible physical layer technology may be enough to provide this incentive alone, if OptiPulse were to follow a strategy of exclusively promoting its mesh network
capabilities.  However, this would be unecessarily prescriptive and possibly counterproductive; a better way to show users the advantages of mesh networks would be to give them
a reason to try it for themselves so that they'd come to understand the benefits through firsthand experience.

With the amount of excess bandwidth the Light Grid may be giving customers, they may be able to get away with sharing (or selling) what they don't use to those around them.
(It might not occur to someone with a 12 Mb/s connection to try this).  In effect, this would make buyers of OptiPulse's internet service their own mini ISP's,
analagous to operators of once-widespread internet cafes.  With some added income from selling bandwidth, OptiPulse's users may be able to break even or even make a profit while
receiving some of the best internet service on the market.

*** Building the Platform to End Platforms
This implies that OptiPulse, as an ISP, might sell internet that comes with a commercial license (or form thereof) to end-users.  While this would give users the ability to resell
service and potentially cut into some of OptiPulse's target market, there would be some overwhelmingly positive side-effects:

- Each customer ultimately connected through an OptiPulse uplink is one fewer customer of an OptiPulse competitor.
- It would be hard to overestimate customer satisfaction with such a deal.  This would grow the network of app users possibly exponentially, and if every transaction is charged a certain amount to go into OptiPulse's "tip jar", this could grow astronomically.
- If OptiPulse wished to prevent any portion of profit whatsoever from being appropriated by end-users, it would be very simple to stipulate in a smart contract that customers can only sell to those out of range of OptiPulse service.  Other schemes have been proposed, such as offering customers the opportunity to become an OptiPulse franchise.

These benefits seem especially appealing considering that Mesh Market can facilitate other types of exchange besides internet service.  Given the rise of companies like
Uber, AirBnB, Craigslist and others -- the services of each of which Mesh Market can replicate -- a general strategy of growing a base network of users and promoting new use-cases
could prove very lucrative.

In the language of Mesh Market, offers translate into smart contracts, which in turn serve as licenses that may be offered by companies acting as users of the platform.  The products/services
of these companies are the driving force behind Mesh Market's various use-cases.  The Mesh Market platform gives these companies free reign over their own contracts, so they are free to test the waters
between the platform and pipelines philosophies.  Minimizing the demand Mesh-Market places on users -- be they large companies or first-time DIY'ers -- ensures that the platform
remains agnostic towards content and inviting to any type of endeavor.

* Application
** Design
One design decision built into Mesh Market is to treat users, whether they be businesses or end consumers in the conventional sense, as basically having the same requirements for using the Mesh Market platform.  This creates an amorphous market inscrutable to classical economists - but where choices tend to multiply and services improve, therefore fulfilling the functions of healthy economy.
An ISP using the Mesh Market platform to sell internet service without restrictions on how it does so, and customers as (perhaps equally)
non-restricted entitites that may act as "mini ISP's" in their own right.  Therefore, the most effective design is one that meets the business requirements of the "producers", while making no distinction between them
and consumers of their products.  The core features of the app, described below, are an attempt to create such an
environment.

Mesh networks are inherently friendly to businesses embracing the platform model.  With a decentralized and free communications medium, viable local alternatives to inefficient,
sub-par goods and services can be discovered.  This is how "free markets" are supposed to work; they only free and efficient insofar as information flow is.

Incidentally, this is why there is no paid advertising on the Mesh Market platform.  It is an intentional design decision that the only information users see when looking for offers is
what they decide is relevant to making a good choice.

To create a new wallet, you just need to come up with a good password (your private key.)  Careful!  If you lose/forget this, it can never be retrieved.
***** Open Wallet
In order to add offers to Mesh Market, you will need your address (the public key you were given when you created your wallet) and your password.
**** D. Protocol: Definining Resource Consumption for the Future
The Mesh Market protocol provides dynamically updated in-app documentation for:
- the features of the app itself
- the contents of offers available in the app

The Mesh Market Foundation will release an initial protocol specification.  Further development of the protocol may be determined democratically by user-submitted
entries, which is handled in a section of the website separate from the app.

A protocol entry includes:
- a tag
- a recommendation
- a justification

The Mesh Market protocol specifies which technologies are conducive to the overall goals of the Mesh Market Foundation.  Businesses (and individuals acting as businesses)
may apply for grants to help them develop

Each user-submitted protocol entry undergoes vetting before it is added to the Protocol Object, which is a JSON object referenced for dynamic updating of in-app documentation.
Vetting is simple: those entries that receive more upvotes than downvotes are added to the Protocol Object.
***** example protocol entry:

#+BEGIN_SRC json


{"tag1":
  {"upvotes": "",

***** Meshmarks: A Credit System for Enabling Seemless Interaction with the Blockchain
Offers on the Mesh Market can be paid for in currencies of the offer maker's choosing, as well as in the Mesh Market's own virtual currency, Meshmarks.

Meshmarks enables easy conversion between payment methods.  Users can load credit to their account using PayPal, credit, debit, or a crypto-currency of their choice.

Users are not required to buy Meshmarks to make transactions with one-another, but it does help users using unequal payment methods (e.g. Bitcoin and PayPal) reach one-another.

***** A Possible Cryptocurrency (MMR)
One possibility that should be discussed is the minting of a new crypto-currency to serve as store credit.  As such, it would be bound to the growth of decentralized resources.

* The Mesh Market Foundation
The form the app eventually takes on will determine the type of business that can best support it.  Presently, a non-profit DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)
seems like the most effective way to channel funds generated by the app can be used to encourage businesses - most likely through grants - to decentralize and liberate their services
for increased customer participation.
